<PageLayout title='Dashboard' subtitle={`Welcome back, ${state.user?.name}!`} actions={<WebSocketStatus />}>
  <Row gutter={[24, 24]}>
    <Col xs={24} sm={8}>
      <EnhancedStatisticCard
        title='Total Referrals'
        value={14}
        prefix={<TeamOutlined />}
        valueStyle={{ color: chartColors.primary }}
        elevation={2}
        tooltip="Total number of brands you've referred to GoKwik"
      />
    </Col>
    {/* More content... */}
  </Row>
</PageLayout>
```

## Implementation Details

### Elevation System

The elevation system consists of four levels:

1. **Level 1 (Default)**: `box-shadow: 0 2px 8px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.08)`
2. **Level 2 (Highlighted)**: `box-shadow: 0 4px 12px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1)`
3. **Level 3 (Modal/Drawer)**: `box-shadow: 0 8px 24px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.12)`
4. **Level 4 (Floating Action)**: `box-shadow: 0 12px 32px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.16)`

### Color System

The color system has been updated to match the GoKwik design language:

- **Primary Color**: Deep Blue (`#003c71`)
- **Accent Color**: Teal (`#00BFA6`)
- **Secondary Colors**: Various colors for different purposes (success, warning, error, etc.)

### Animation System

Animations and transitions have been standardized:

- **Fast**: 150ms ease
- **Normal**: 300ms ease
- **Slow**: 500ms ease

## Next Steps

1. **Apply to All Pages**: Update all pages to use the new components and design system
2. **Responsive Design**: Ensure all components work well on mobile devices
3. **Accessibility**: Ensure all components are accessible
4. **Documentation**: Create comprehensive documentation for the design system
5. **Testing**: Test the new components and design system with users

## Conclusion

The UI/UX redesign implementation provides a solid foundation for a modern, dimensional interface that aligns with the GoKwik design language. The new components and design system make it easy to create consistent, visually appealing pages throughout the application.
